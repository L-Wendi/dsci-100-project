    "An angina is commonly a symptom of cardiovascular disease. It occurs when parts of the heart are not supplied with sufficient oxygen-rich blood as a result of plaque build-up in arteries, known as atherosclerosis (NHLBI, 2023). Atherosclerosis itself is usually caused by high levels of cholesterol that build up in the walls of said arteries, triggering an immune response from the organism, implicating white blood cells that target these build ups but instead get stuck in the areas they attempt to clear, forming a growing lump or structure that permanently stays in place (Harvard Health, 2023). As a result, less red blood cells carrying oxygen are able to pass through the artery at any one time. Exercising can therefore aggravate this phenomenon as our heart rate increases, to supply more oxygen to the cells in need, especially cardiac ones, inducing chest pain, known as an exercise induced angina. The higher demand in oxygen, but restricted supply due to the shrunken diameter of the artery due to the plaque build up leads to the death of cardiac cells that are unable to receive the necessary oxygen (Heart and Stroke Canada). \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "As a result, we strive for our model to predict the presence of an exercise induced angina for random individuals, taking into account their resting blood pressure as well as their cholesterol levels measured in dl/mg. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Our research question is as follows: **Based on resting blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels, is the patient likely to experience exercise induced angina? How accurate is this prediction?**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We are using a 1988 heart disease dataset that contains 17 variables correlating to cardiovascular health as well as patients' age, sex, chest pain, blood pressure, cholestoral, blood sugar, ECG results, and more. Our dataset has 1025 rows of data from Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. We chose this dataset because it provides a comprehensive amount of variables to compare with, and it also has a large number of samples. Our dataset comes from Kaggle, and it is a compilation of the original dataset on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease, but processed to be ready for data analysis.\r\n",
